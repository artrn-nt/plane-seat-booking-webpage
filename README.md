# plane-seat-booking-webpage
Dynamic and responsive single webpage designed for a fictive airway company.
Through this web page the user can select a flight destination and some seats in the traveler cabin of a plane. Then, after seats positions have been chosen, an order can be submitted.
This project also includes register and login forms built using plain Javascript.

# What I've learnt?
- Basically I've learnt JavaScript by making this little project: syntax, "built-in methods" (like map, filter, splice, slice, indexOf, etc.), interactions with HTML and CSS, how to use local storage in browser and many other things...
- I enhanced a lot my HTML/CSS comprehension
- This project also involves quite a bit of logic so it made me also work that thing too
